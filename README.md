# About me
Due to life changes I became interested in sofware testing. I have completed professional ISTQB training and practical training in the field of Manual Testing. 
I passed exam of certificate ISTQB (04.2023).
In this portfolio I would like to share my testing knowledge and exhibit my technical skills, which I gained during the testing course
I have completed and through self-learning. Also I am determined to prove the skills I have already acquired and keep developing in this field.  I intend to gain professional experience in this direction and find good job.
